        Physics-Informed Neural Networks -- M. Raissi & P. Perdikaris & G.E. Karniadakis

        <ul>
            <li>Structured data are already available for physics, biology and maths which are not combined to be used with Machine learning techniques</li>
            <li>The paper further cites Gaussian process regression models. For a smooth function say eg temperature change
                during day, the model can be trained on a few data points and then used to predict the temperature at any point in time. 
                And can predict the uncertainty in the prediction as well.</li>
            <li>Physics informed neural networks are a class of neural networks that can be trained on
                data from physics, biology and maths. The neural networks can be trained on a few data points and then used to predict the value at any point in time.
                The neural networks can also predict the uncertainty in the prediction.</li>
            </li>
            <li>But on non linearity cases, the expected uncertainty increases</li>
            <li>This issue is solved by differentiate neural networks with respect to their
55 input coordinates and model parameters to obtain physics-informed neural
56 networks.</li>
